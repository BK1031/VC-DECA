# VC DECA App

Welcome to the VC DECA App repository!

The goal of this app is to make communication easier between officers, advisors, and members of the club. It also allows members to access all the information they need about competitive events and conferences.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Equinox-Initiative/VC-DECA-flutter/wiki) for an in-depth breakdown of features and documentation.

## Getting Started

You will need to have [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and Dart installed in order to build the repository. You can check out the installation instructions below.

## Building the App

Go ahead and download the repository.

Open up the entire folder in your favorite IDE. I would recommend IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code as they are fully supported to run and develop Flutter applications.

Run the following terminal command in the main project folder.

`$ flutter packages get`

***Note: If you are using IntelliJ or VS Code, make sure you have the Dart and Flutter plugins installed!***

If you are going to run the iOS version, make sure to open `Runner.xcworkspace` from the `ios` folder with Xcode and set the development team.

Running the android version shouldn't require any additional setup as long as you are just using the emulator.
